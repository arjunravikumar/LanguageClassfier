An exoenzyme or extracellular enzyme is an enzyme that is secreted by a cell and functions outside of that cell,20,en
Exoenzymes are produced by both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and have been shown to be a crucial component of many biological processes,22,en
Most often these enzymes are involved in the breakdown of larger macromolecules,12,en
The breakdown of these larger macromolecules is critical for allowing their constituents to pass through the cell membrane and enter into the cell,23,en
For humans and other complex organisms this process is best characterized by the digestive system which breaks down solid food via exoenzymes,22,en
The small molecules generated by the exoenzyme activity enter into cells and are utilized for various cellular functions,18,en
Bacteria and fungi also produce exoenzymes to digest nutrients in their environment and these organisms can be used to conduct laboratory assays to identify the presence and function of such exoenzymes,31,en
Some pathogenic species also use exoenzymes as virulence factors to assist in the spread of these disease causing microorganisms,19,en
In addition to the integral roles in biological systems different classes of microbial exoenzymes have been used by humans since prehistoric times for such diverse purposes as food production biofuels textile production and in the paper industry,37,en
Another important role that microbial exoenzymes serve is in the natural ecology and bioremediation of terrestrial and marine environments,19,en

Matakerepō in a Māori story of the Arawa tribe of Rotorua is a female ancestor of the hero Tāwhaki,19,en
She is an example of the female helper a recurrent element in Polynesian myth and legend who assists Tāwhaki to attain his quest of finding his wife and daughter from whom he is estranged,34,en
Matakerepō is a somewhat threatening figure who must be placated,10,en
Soon after Tāwhaki and his slave set off on their journey they come upon Matakerepō guarding the vines or ropes that form the pathway up into the heavens where Tāwhakis daughter Puanga and his wife Hāpai are living,38,en
As she counts out the ten taro tubers that are heaped in front of her Tāwhaki removes the tenth taro when Matakerepō has reached nine,25,en
She counts again and this time Tāwhaki removes the ninth tuber,11,en
This continues until the old woman realises that someone is deceiving her,12,en
She begins to sniff the air and her stomach distends ready to swallow the stranger,15,en
She sniffs towards the south then towards the east and towards all the winds,14,en
When she sniffs towards the west she catches Tāwhakis scent,10,en
She calls out Are you come with the wind that blows on my skin Tāwhaki grunts and Matakerepō says Oh it is my grandson Tāwhaki,25,en
As she says this her stomach begins to shrink again,10,en
If he had not been from the west wind she would have swallowed him whole,15,en
Matakerepō then asks Tāwhaki where he is going,8,en
He tells her that he is searching for his daughter who is with his wife for his wife is a daughter of Whatitirimatakamataka or Whaitiri goddess of thunder and has returned to her home in the heavens,37,en

In the morning the slave prepares a meal to make Tāwhaki strong for his journey,15,en
Tāwhaki presents his slave to Matakerepō who gives him further advice on how to climb the vines and makes an incantation to help him as climbs off into the sky,30,en
When he reaches the heavens Tāwhaki disguises himself as an old slave and assists his brothersinlaw to build a canoe,20,en
Each night the brothersinlaw return to their village where Tāwhakis wife and daughter are living,15,en

Second messengers are intracellular signaling molecules released by the cell in response to exposure to extracellular signaling molecules—the first messengers,20,en
Second messengers trigger physiological changes such as proliferation differentiation migration survival and apoptosis,13,en
They are one of the triggers of intracellular signal transduction cascades,11,en
Examples of second messenger molecules include cyclic AMP cyclic GMP inositol trisphosphate diacylglycerol and calcium,15,en
First messengers are extracellular factors often hormones or neurotransmitters such as epinephrine growth hormone and serotonin,16,en
Because peptide hormones and neurotransmitters typically are biochemically hydrophilic molecules these first messengers may not physically cross the phospholipid bilayer to initiate changes within the cell directly—unlike steroid hormones which usually do,32,en
This functional limitation necessitates the cell to devise signal transduction mechanisms to transduce first messenger into second messengers so that the extracellular signal may be propagated intracellularly,27,en
An important feature of the second messenger signaling system is that second messengers may be coupled downstream to multicyclic kinase cascades to greatly amplify the strength of the original first messenger signal,32,en
For example RasGTP signals link with the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase MAPK cascade to amplify the allosteric activation of proliferative transcription factors such as Myc and CREB,27,en
Earl Wilbur Sutherland Jr,4,en
discovered second messengers for which he won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine,14,en
Sutherland saw that epinephrine would stimulate the liver to convert glycogen to glucose sugar in liver cells but epinephrine alone would not convert glycogen to glucose,26,en
He found that epinephrine had to trigger a second messenger cyclic AMP for the liver to convert glycogen to glucose,20,en
The mechanisms were worked out in detail by Martin Rodbell and Alfred G,13,en
Gilman who won the Nobel Prize,6,en
Secondary messenger systems can be synthesized and activated by enzymes for example the cyclases that synthesize cyclic nucleotides or by opening of ion channels to allow influx of metal ions for example Ca signaling,34,en
These small molecules bind and activate protein kinases ion channels and other proteins thus continuing the signaling cascade,18,en

The Ludwigslied in English Lay or Song of Ludwig is an Old High German OHG poem of rhyming couplets celebrating the victory of the Frankish army led by Louis III of France over Danish Viking raiders at the Battle of SaucourtenVimeu on August,43,en
The poem is thoroughly Christian in ethos,7,en
It presents the Viking raids as a punishment from God He caused the Northmen to come across the sea to remind the Frankish people of their sins and inspired Louis to ride to the aid of his people,38,en
Louis praises God both before and after the battle,9,en
Although the poem is Christian in content and the use of rhyme reflects Christian rather than pagan Germanic poetry it belongs to the genre of Preislied a song in praise of a warrior of a type which is presumed to have been common in Germanic oral tradition,47,en
The poem is preserved in over four pages in a single thcentury manuscript formerly in the monastery of SaintAmand now in the Bibliothèque municipale Valenciennes Codex f,27,en
In the same manuscript and written by the same scribe is the Old French Sequence of Saint Eulalia,18,en
The poem speaks of Louis in the present tense it opens I know a king called Ludwig who willingly serves God,21,en
I know he will reward him for it,8,en
Since Louis died in August the next year the poem must have been written within a year of the battle,20,en
However in the manuscript the poem is headed by the Latin rubric Ritmus teutonicus de piae memoriae Hluduice rege German song to the beloved memory of King Louis which means it must be a copy of an earlier text,39,en
Most regard it as the sole textual example of the otherwise little known West Frankish dialect which is assumed to have been the language of the Salian Franks,28,en
This dialect is supposed to have been a descendant of Old Frankish that was spoken in West Francia closely related to the Franconian dialects of Old High German as spoken in East Francia but not identical with any single one of them,42,en
It may also be attested in a small OHG–Latin glossary known as Pariser Gespräche it does not only give translations for single words but also for short everyday sentences acting as a sort of practical language guide or phrase book for travellers,42,en
Some regard it as Rhenish Franconian though there are some peculiarities which have received a variety of explanations,18,en
